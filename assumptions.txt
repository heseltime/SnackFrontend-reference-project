assumptions (assignment)

- one single student, already logged in, central order management (student perspective)
- also only orders per session stored: local storage for this (data model not built out to link customers and orders, actually)
- finally: example Restaurant Burgerei assumed, because no association between manager login and restaurants in back in as per spec.
