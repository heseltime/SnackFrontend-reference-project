assumptions (assignment)

- one single student, already logged in, central order management (student perspective)
    See testStudent in discover-restaurants.component.ts
- also only orders per session stored: local storage for this (data model not built out to link customers and orders, actually)
- finally: example Restaurant Burgerei assumed, because no association between manager login and restaurants in back in as per spec.
    See testRestaurant and testApiKey in home.component.ts (testRestaurant also in login.component.ts)
